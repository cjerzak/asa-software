  "justification": "Ramona Moye Camaconi was born in 1982 and emerged as a prominent indigenous leader within the TIPNIS territory. Prior to her election to the Chamber of Deputies in 2014, she served as the President of the Women's Organization of the Sub Central Sécure. This role as a grassroots community leader in a rural indigenous territory, coupled with the lack of formal professional or academic titles in official parliamentary records, maps to a working-class background according to the provided criteria."
