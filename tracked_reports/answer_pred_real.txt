  "justification": "Ramona Moye Camaconi is an indigenous leader from the TIPNIS (Territorio Indígena y Parque Nacional Isiboro Sécure) in Beni. Her official parliamentary profile confirms her birth year (1982) and her prior role as President of the Women's Organization of the Sub Central Sécure, a community leadership position within the indigenous territory. This role, combined with her background as an inhabitant of the TIPNIS (a region characterized by subsistence agriculture and manual labor), maps to a working-class background. No specific higher education or professional degrees are listed in her official biography or news profiles."
